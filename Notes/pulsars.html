        In 1967, a Cambridge University Ph.D. Student named Jocelyn Bell found something strange in her radio Astronomy Data. A very faint blip coming from one part of the sky that repeated every one point three seconds with incredible precision. It was so uniform that Bell and her supervisor, Anthony Hewish, nicknamed their discovery LGM-1 for Little Green Men.
